Project 4 Parallel Computing --- Due 4/2/20 at 23:59

For this project you are to take advantage of GPU's  
capabilities offered.


OPTION 1
Following the examples provided, construct a matrix multiply
program, using CUDA for the GPU.  Run your project on a variety
of matrix sizes.  You should include a discussion of the improved
efficiency and comment on the relative speed up of your
implementation. Run your application on GPU, be sure you monitor
the machine load when collecting your data. 

shar you project and upload the shar file to osprey then turn it
in with turnin using reepar4 as the turnin code.

OPTION 2
Implement a parallel quicksort. Algorithms can be found
online for implementing a GPU quicksort.
